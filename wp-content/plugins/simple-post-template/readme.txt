Simple, pre-written post content templates for your posts and pages. Use HTML to pre-fill new posts with the default content of your choice.

== Description ==

**Custom Post Types, Custom Fields, Tags, Categories, Featured Images: if you need any of these, you should check out our pro plugin, Advanced Content Templates: <a href="https://advancedcontenttemplates.com">Advanced Content Templates</a>**

Many bloggers use a similar format for each of their posts. WordPress doesn't provide a native way to pre-fill your new posts with default content. This plugin provides the simplest solution to this problem. It takes 5 minutes to install and setup. The templates allows you to define a title, post body, and even an excerpt.

* In my clean up of the last release, I forgot to apply the fixes to the template editor, which caused some abnormalities.  I apologize!

**Version 2.0.5**

* Bug fixes.

**Version 2.0.4:**

* Sacre bleu! A change in the way Wordpress handles plugin updates 3 major releases ago prevented upgrades from 1.x to 2.x from working. This should be fixed with this release. So sorry for the confusion!

**Version 2.0.3:**

* Fixed bug where HTML in templates messed up templates layout.
